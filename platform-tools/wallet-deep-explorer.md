# ðŸ”µ Wallet Deep Explorer

Our Deep Wallet Explorer is a robust core tool within Alphanomics specifically designed to provide comprehensive alpha insights into any wallet address. With this tool, you can effortlessly access crucial information such as historical and potential future trade behaviours, performances, wallet movements, and holdings.&#x20;

By examining past performance, we can assign significance to recent transactions within wallets where the owners are unknown.&#x20;

This enables us to deduce whether the wallet belongs to a savvy DEX trader or a long-term holder regardless of identity. Additionally, you can track noteworthy wallets that exhibit impressive performance or have a consistent track record, allowing you to engage in strategies like copy trading and discovering new buying/selling opportunities before the masses.

### How to use?

Simply head to Wallet Deep Explorer under the DEX Tool Suite and within the alpha search box, paste any wallet address!
