# ðŸ”µ Live DEX Master

This forms the foundation of Alphanomics - a live and continuous real-time stream of on-chain data encompassing the majority of DEX AMM transactions. This stream provides the most up-to-date and authentic overview of the broader marketplace, giving a pulse on the current state of affairs.

By continuously receiving a stream of on-chain data, we can accurately observe the real-time actions and behaviors of the market, in contrast to the noise found on something like Twitter. With our platform, you will have visibility into every individual buy, sell, or swap occurring across all selected chains and Automated Market Makers (AMMs).

To provide you with real-time insights, we have positioned three segmented summary tables at the top. These tables display the essentials such as "Total Market Cap, Volume (24hr/7days)", "Top Whale Transactions" and "Top Volume Tokens," allowing you to instantly observe significant transactions and tokens with the highest trading volume. These  serve as indicators of areas of interest, market traction and enabling us to further explore and uncover valuable information regarding tokens and wallets.

* **Timestamp**
* **Type of trade**
* **Token involved**
* **Price of the trade**
* **Amount traded**
* **Wallet and Transaction details**&#x20;
