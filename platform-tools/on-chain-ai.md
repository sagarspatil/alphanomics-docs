# ðŸ”µ On-Chain AI

On-Chain AI is one of our flagship modules, designed to help users discover and monitor anomalies in on-chain data processed through the Alphanomics terminal. We handle millions of transactions daily, with an internal system that filters, processes and flags any unusual activity.

Users can access these insights and signals powered by AI, leveraging our data to surface projects that might otherwise go unnoticed. You can also narrow your focus by selecting specific sectors to refine the On-Chain AI signals.

This module offers benefits like speed, enhanced discovery, and short-term risk management, outperforming social media and manual browsing in efficiency.
