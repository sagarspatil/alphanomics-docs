# ⛓️ AI Agent: nomAI

**nomAI** is an autonomous AI agent built on the Virtuals protocol powered by Alphanomics on-chain data.

* It taps directly into Alphanomics’ on-chain data pipelines tick-level DEX flows, “Smart Money” (top 0.01 % trader) data, and real-time whale flows to generate trade signals seconds after they appear on-chain.
* The agent’s goal is to capture early asymmetric opportunities and anomaly on-chain transactions that most surface after the risk factor is at the tail end.
