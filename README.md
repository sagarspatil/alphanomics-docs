# Welcome to Alphanomics

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

Trading and investing in the crypto markets is synonymous with the byproduct of millions upon millions of on-chain data transactions. This data is typically overlooked and rightly so, as vast amounts of raw crypto data without interpretation, aggregation or any kind of optimised interface make it fairly unusable and unhelpful. &#x20;

On top of this, having insufficient context with crucial data points such as wallet anonymity, relationships and overall market sentiment missing will only cause further confusion and even lower utility.

Alphanomics was designed to solve this by allowing end users to leverage this powerful transaction data in easy to digest and extremely useful manner for their future trades and investment decisions.
