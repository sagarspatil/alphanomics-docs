# âš¡ Hot Trending Tokens

Alphanomics is an on-chain DEX data intelligence platform designed to transform how people interact with crypto data and help identify asymmetric opportunities, mitigate risk, and assist/execute with portfolio management.&#x20;

Over half a billion people hold crypto assets, but less than 1% use on-chain data due to complexities.&#x20;

We solve this and bridge the gap by building an intuitive intelligence platform that leverages AI technologies and make it readily available for the on-chain community.

We have a unique proprietary system for analyzing the top trending tokens among millions of projects, so you can quickly spot and discover opportunities.&#x20;

Our method combines key trading metrics such as volume, liquidity, number of holders, unique wallets, and transactions. Additionally, we consider NOMICS Scores, active community sentiment, and the number of unique visitors to each token's individual Token Genius page.
