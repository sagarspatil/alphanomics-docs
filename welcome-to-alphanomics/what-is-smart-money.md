# ðŸ§  What is Smart Money?

At Alphanomics, we internally categorize various segments of Smart Money. Generally, "Smart Money" refers to investors who are better informed than typical retail investors, and therefore, their on-chain activities hold significant influence.

We have curated a list of nearly 16,000 Smart Money addresses, categorized into segments such as prominent funds and entities, whales, venture capitalists, elite traders, and noteworthy public figures.

Additionally, we feature SMDT (Smart Money DEX Traders), a dynamic and perpetually updated list of top PNL traders. Our proprietary algorithm continuously monitors on-chain traders who consistently achieve high win rates, realize substantial profits, and demonstrate a keen understanding of market trends. This ensures that our data remains up-to-date and relevant.\
