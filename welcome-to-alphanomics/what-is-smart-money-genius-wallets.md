# ðŸ§  What is Smart Money / Genius Wallets?

At Alphanomics, we internally categorize various segments of Smart Money. Generally, "Smart Money" refers to investors who are better informed than typical retail investors, and therefore, their on-chain activities hold significant influence.

We have curated a list of nearly 16,000 Genius Wallets (and constantly updating/cleansing), categorized into segments such as prominent funds and entities, whales, venture capitalists, elite traders, and noteworthy public figures.

Additionally, we feature Genius Wallets (The top 0.01% On-Chain entities), a dynamic and perpetually updated list of top PNL traders using our own AI engine.&#x20;

Our proprietary algorithm continuously monitors on-chain entities and wallets who consistently achieve high win rates, realize substantial profits, and demonstrate a keen understanding of market trends. This ensures that our data remains up-to-date and relevant.  This is what makes our platform extremely useful to navigate this chaotic space.
