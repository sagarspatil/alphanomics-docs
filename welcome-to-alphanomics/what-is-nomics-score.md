# ðŸ’§ What is NOMICS Score?

The NOMICS Score is a unique algorithmic score combining several pillars that revolve around security audit scores, holder count, fair token distribution, liquidity, transactions, community sentiment and up-to-date profile pages on Token Genius.

We have developed this to help protect our users as much as possible and highlight any potential risks; whilst we cannot guarantee the external audits, we highly recommend you practice heavy risk management and do your own research on all tokens regardless of the score.&#x20;
