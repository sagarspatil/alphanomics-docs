# ⛓️ NomieWorld NFT Collaboration

Our team is happy to announce a meaningful yet fun way to reward our early founding community as we approach our alpha release - rewarding loyalty within a community creates a sustainable environment, especially for those who have been with us since inception.

We've collaborated with NomieWorld to craft an innovative, rewarding web3 approach for our community: The Nomiemons NFT Collection! Not only does it help onboard even more users on-chain, but it also lets our own community take part in gaining the full Alphanomics experience!

With this special collaboration and partnership, Nomiemon NFT's will grant both access to Alphanomics platform + Earn Reward Points for user loyalty.

The Nomiemons NFT Art Collection -  These are limited edition fun art pieces of the cute and fun 'Nomies'.  You may have seen a bunch of Nomiemons randomly placed around whilst using Alphanomics, but here you can mint and own your very own unique pfp and own it.

The Nomimons will be priced fairly for the community from 0.007 ETH each to make them extremely accessible to enable optimal fair distribution. Max mint will be 10 per wallet for those who are whitelisted or have used our platform during beta.   Details on the mint on [this page here](broken-reference).

Simply hold at least 10 Nomiemon NFT's in the same wallet and you will unlock PRO in your Alphanomics account or 1 NFT to unlock Plus.

You will be able to check your points on your own dashboard once we have updated the system this year (under My Profile).

**NOTE:** You must keep all your NFT's in the same wallet as the address attached to your Alphanomics account.

Reward points can be redeemed in future for exclusive NFT badge mints, Merch, Account Upgrade Credits and contribute to things such as future airdrops. &#x20;
