# ⛓️ Account Plans & Access

Our objective is to deliver a robust and user-friendly application that encourages widespread adoption in the cryptocurrency landscape, while ensuring accessibility for a diverse range of users. In pursuit of this goal, we have made our all-in-one platform completely free to utilize.

By creating a Starter account, you will gain access to some of our fundamental product features like the Live DEX Master, Token Genius (Lite), and the Wallet Deep Explorer.

For those who desire to take their experience to the next level and attain a greater edge and advantage, we provide the option to upgrade to our PLUS and NEXUS-enabled platform.&#x20;

Both PLUS and PRO enable access to even more powerful features and functionalities.

**To access the account tiers, users simply own enough ANOM points.**
