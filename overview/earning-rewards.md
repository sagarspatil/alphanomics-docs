# ⛓️ Earning Rewards

Alphanomics is dedicated to establishing a dynamic and flourishing network and community on defi and on-chain enthusiasts. To achieve this, we have introduced a rewards system where members are incentivized for inviting other high value crypto on chain enthusiasts to join the Alphanomics platform.

There are several ways to earn reward points as detailed below or holding Nomieworld and other qualifying NFT's. NFT's must be held in the same wallet, points will be determined depening on the type and time elapsed since the NFT was held.  Points will be reset and lost if NFT's are transferred or sold.

**Reward points will be redeemed in future for NFT's, Merch, Account Upgrade Credits and also contribute to future community airdrops.**&#x20;

## Earning Reward Points by Referrals

For each successful invite and for helping us grow as a community, **you will receive +5 reward points** and additional bonus points based on the level of activity demonstrated by each participant you invited. (We want to attract the highest quality alpha seekers on our platform!).  Each account will have a maximum of 1000 invites.  More can be requested manually to our mods in our community chat groups.

More points for engagement, genuine use of the platform, helpful Twitter threads on on-chain alpha discoveries and actual genuine analysis on tokens using our platform (not just copy/paste),  and being an active member in our discord group.

As you accumulate points, you will also earn and unlock Alphanomics rank badges, awarded once you reach specific point thresholds - at each level you unlock an exclusive mint link for each of these badges.
