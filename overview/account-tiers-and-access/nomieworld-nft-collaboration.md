# ⛓️ NomieWorld NFT Collaboration

Our team is happy to announce a meaningful yet fun way to reward our early founding community as we approach our alpha release - rewarding loyalty within a community creates a sustainable environment, especially for those who have been with us since inception.

We've collaborated with NomieWorld to craft an innovative, rewarding web3 approach for our community: The Nomiemons NFT Collection! Not only does it help onboard even more users on-chain, but it also lets our own community take part in gaining the full Alphanomics experience!

With this special collaboration and partnership, Nomiemon NFT's will grant both access to Alphanomics platform + Earn Reward Points for user loyalty.

The Nomiemons NFT Art Collection - 5000 will be made available for the community.  These are limited edition fun art pieces of the cute and fun 'Nomies'.  You may have seen a bunch of Nomiemons randomly placed around whilst using Alphanomics, but here you can mint and own your very own unique pfp and own it.

Nomiemons will have incredible BONUS perks and utility such as unlocking lifetime Alphanomics PLUS account access (worth $1,200 per year) - [see Account Tiers here](./), access to a private discord group, access to our Premium Alphanomics Research Newsletter, future airdrops and also a very important reward points producer of 5 reward points per hour.

Yes, keep reading - we will explain the reward points later!

The Nomimons will be priced fairly for the community from 0.007 ETH each to make them extremely accessible to enable optimal fair distribution. Max mint will be 10 per wallet for those who are whitelisted or have used our platform during beta.   Details on the mint on [this page here](broken-reference)[.](https://nomiemons.alphanomics.io/)

After receiving an overwhelming amount of messages from our beta users on how they can attain access to our PRO tier, with our collaboration - simply hold at least 10 Nomiemon NFT's in the same wallet and you will unlock PRO in your Alphanomics account.

Again, this has been priced to reward the earliest users by giving PRO access for life at a fraction of the cost (normally $2,400/yr - so either one has to pay $2,400 every year or own 10 Nomimon NFTs), including all future updates for PRO, amongst many other benefits.

You will be able to check your points on your own dashboard (under My Profile).

**NOTE:** You must keep all your NFT's in the same wallet as the address attached to your Alphanomics account.

Reward points can be redeemed in future for exclusive NFT badge mints, Merch, Account Upgrade Credits and contribute to things such as future airdrops. &#x20;

Ecosystem NFT holders will also be able to take part in our SAGE contributors program once launched to help contribute to our web3 data network and earn bonus rewards.
